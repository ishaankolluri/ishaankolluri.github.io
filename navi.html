            <span class="body">Two classmates and I sought to conceptualize and pitch innovative uses of emerging technology at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. We envisioned the use of cheap, ultra-high frequency long-range RFID chips on every book in a library to help inexperienced patrons find informationâ€”using the phone as an augmented reality platform.</span>

                <span class="body">
                I've spent hours working in the library, but the only time I can remember reading books in the library was in the comic book section. Back then, I had memorized the exact physical location of my favorite section, and to this day I still don't know how to properly navigate library shelves.
                </span>
            </p>
            <p class="body">When given the opportunity to investigate new use cases for emerging technology, I jumped at the chance to investigate whether people shared my struggles. After surveying 60 teachers, students, and locals, we found that 85% of respondents did not use the library facilities to search for information, but rather to relax or study. A considerable 80% cited a desire to learn how to use the current library facilities to search for information. Of that 80%, 37% cited the lack of cost as a primary motivator.</p>

                <span class="body">Our team separately conceptualized ways to reinvent the library, a 400-year old institution. We came up with robotic book delivery and voice-assisted guides, but ultimately settled on the use of cheap RFID technology. Our service, NAVi, would leverage an AR camera on your phone to illuminate a path to the book you've searched for. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="body">However, we wanted a potentially technical solution to have implications further than just locating a book. Related novels would be marked on your map, and our solution should facilitate relationships with individuals with similar interests. To that end, we tried to create a video that encapsulated NAVi's value proposition.</p>

            <span class="body">The key behind this solution is the capability of long range RFIDs. If the location of each book can be mapped to the blueprint of the library, this is a technically viable solution.</span>

        <p>
            <span class="body">Given more time, I'd like to refine the visual effects in our video. Pitching a solution that represents a future world requires that the narrative be complemented with graphics that keep the user invested in the fantasy.</span>
