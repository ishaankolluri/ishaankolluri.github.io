            <span class="body" style="color: #ed6564"><b>January 2018 - Present</b></span><br>
            <span class="body">For our master's thesis project, we're serving as design consultants to Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, a company that implements electronic medical record (EMR) software for healthcare organizations. After months of user research and conceptual design, we identified the <b>clinical workflow design process</b> as an opportunity ripe for innovation. We're currently creating prototypes that facilitate workflow design for Allscripts consultants and motivate doctors, nurses, and assistants to provide more feedback. </b></span><br><br>
            <span class="body">We approached our research from the perspective of discovering opportunities for design in EMR training. However, we discovered that while providers disliked the short and digital nature of training, communication and design issues upstream cause many of the inefficiences that contribute to dissatisfaction. We decided to focus our efforts on designing to solve problems early in the implementation process, so that we may identify the root of the problem.  </span>

We measured the impact of regulatory pressure on the development of clinical software, and we identified data analysis and interoperability as key drivers of innovation in the EMR space.</span>

            <span class="body">Starting in March, we started brainstorming solutions to help consultants manage the design of clinical workflows in EMR software. From motivating participation to creating workflow flowcharts, we attempted to create a sprint schedule that would facilitate the development of divergent design concepts.  <br><br>
            <span class="body">We scoped our ideation sessions by naming the underlying question we were designing for. Examples were  <b>how might we make it easier for healthcare employees to give feedback on EMR workflows</b>, or <b>how might we make it easier for implementation consultants to communicate design decisions to client leadership?</b></span>

            <span class="body">It's almost May, and we're waist-deep in user testing. We're using this as an opportunity to figure out whether we're solving the right problem for our clients, and more importantly, EMR end users. We're working on finding better ways to share newly discovered findings with each other, organize vast amounts of documentation, and ask the right questions that surface true feelings during user tests.</span><br><br>
            <span class="body">As we continue to narrow down on ideas with high potential, we'll be increasing the fidelity of our prototypes and formalizing how our potential solution would change the existing Allscripts service model. Hope to report back soon! </span>
