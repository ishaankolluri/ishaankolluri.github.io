            <span class="header">Humanizing autonomous vehicles</span><br>
            <span class="body">I started a research project with two of my classmates in August 2017. We identified an opportunity to interact with autonomous vehicles in Pittsburgh, and through research, identified a cognitive dissonance between how pedestrians thought and behaved around them. To that end, <b>we designed a digital windshield interface to quickly communicate how autonomous vehicles perceive and interpret their surroundings.</b></span>

            <span class="body">Through qualitative interviews and paper prototyping, we found that <b>while many people were vocal about their support of autonomous vehicles in the future, some were cautious or uncomfortable when confronted with self-driving cars on the road.</b> Our findings primarily attributed this to a lack of outward communication from the car to nearby pedestrians. This was exceptionally important in ambiguous on-road situations, such as crosswalks.</span>

            <span class="body">It became clear to us early on that we weren't designing for an idealistic future where pedestrians would only interact with machine drivers. The hypothesis—for the next two to three decades, the roads will have a substantial mix of human and autonomous drivers.<br><br>
            <span class="primary">Thinking fast, not slow.</span><br>
            Drawing inspiration from literature, such as Daniel Kahneman's <i>Thinking Fast and Slow</i>, we identified a rough metric for success: users should be able to process our display in a near-instantaneous fashion. Pedestrians interact with human drivers through eye contact and gestures, resulting in speedy decision-making at crosswalks. We wanted our design to be better than existing solutions from companies like Nissan or BMW.

                <span class="body">After user testing different ways to represent the relationship between the human and the car, we decided to stick with what we were familiar with. In order to keep the interaction between our display and the pedestrian fleeting and effortless, we decided to roughly borrow from physical concepts people are familiar with: signs from pedestrian traffic lights. We decided to represent the human on the windshield, with various states to communicate whether the pedestrian is safe to cross—which it normally always is.</span>
